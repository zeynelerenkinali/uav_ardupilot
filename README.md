Mission projects for understanding the Ardupilot SITL and Gazebo.

### 1. **Basic Autonomous Flight Mission**

- **Goal:** Program the drone to take off, fly to a series of waypoints, and land automatically.
- **Steps:**
    1. Use Mission Planner or MAVProxy to define 3-4 GPS waypoints.
    2. Set up an automatic takeoff at the beginning and a landing command at the final waypoint.
    3. Simulate different conditions (wind, obstacles) to understand how the drone reacts and how to adjust parameters for flight stability.
- **Focus:** Learn basic mission planning, waypoint management, and automatic control.
